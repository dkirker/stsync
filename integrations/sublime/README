First make sure that the stsync.sh command can be reached from your
default path (just open a shell and enter "stsync.sh" without quotes).

If this is not the case, make sure to edit the path variable so it's
reachable.

Next, copy the SmartThings.sublime-build into Sublime's Packages/User
folder and make sure the "Tools > Build System > SmartThings" is checked.

Voila, you can now use F7 to upload and publish a file.

Notes!
If you're running Sublime on OSX, you may need to install "Fix Mac Path",
see https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Fix%20Mac%20Path or the path changes
you've made will not carry over to Sublime.
